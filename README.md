# Fork Notes

We temporarily forked this as we needed `embedded_hal` 1.0 support.
Furthermore, a different probing mechanism and a delayed read mechanism (both inspired by the official driver) are required for this to work on the ESP32.
We expect this fork to only be used in our specific application (Edgeless) and as a possible starting point for a proper upgrade of the upstream repository.

# Rust Sensor SCD30

A rust driver (and CLI utility) for the [scd30](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/carbon-dioxide-sensors-co2/) CO2, Temperature and Humidity sensor.

## Usage

Add the library to your project with `cargo add sensor-scd30` or with `sensor-scd30 = { version = "0.1.0", features = [] }` in your `Cargo.toml`.

Install the utility with one of the following methods:

- using a precompiled binary from the [releases](https://github.com/ryankurte/rust-sensor-scd30/releases/) page
- from source using cargo with `cargo install sensor-scd30`

Run `scd30-util` to communicate with the sensor.

Help:
```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo ./scd30-util --help
scd30-util 0.1.0
Ryan Kurte <ryankurte@gmail.com>
A Command Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with a local Scd30 environmental sensor over I2C

USAGE:
    scd30-util [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -d, --i2c <i2c>                  Specify the i2c interface to use to connect to the scd30 device [env: SCD30_I2C=]
                                     [default: /dev/i2c-1]
        --log-level <level>          Enable verbose logging [default: info]
    -p, --sample-period <period>     Specify period for taking measurements [default: 10s]
        --poll-delay <poll_delay>    Delay between sensor poll operations [default: 100ms]
```

Example output:
```
